      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time reading from the MDN website, meeting with my team and
          starting my Block 2 assginment. I'm looking to putting my block idea
          to the test! I can't believe we only have few weeks left!! (Personal
          Note: For some reason, the code won't ask for permission to access our
          location... but it does on VS Code just fine... I wonder what is
          misssing???)
