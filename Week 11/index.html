      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time meeting with my team, working on the team activity and
          working on my final project. Right now, my project should take user
          input from the form and store it in local storage. Next week I need to
          be able to display what is in localstorage and be able to delete each
          list.
