      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent most my time with the readings. There was a lot to review,
          some I remembered, some I did not. I think I'm to have to practice a
          lot to have a solid footing with the basics.

          This week we had our first team meeting. I like my team members a lot,
          I hope I will be an asset to them, and not a weight that slows them
          down.

      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Has it become better practice to use the backtick character for all
          strings or just for strings that display variable values?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          What are "Symbols" used for? How are they anymore useful than const
          values?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Are bitwise operaters used extensively in web programming? How are
          they useful?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Which are more useful in larger websites, sets or arrays?</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          I can see why week sets can be useful since they can be used to help
          prevent memory leaks, but they only take on "non-primative" datatypes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          It seems to be good practice to use switch statements rather than
          multiple if...else statements.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Are there any other advantage to hoisting other than keeping the
          function declarations at the bottom of the code?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Arrow functions saves space, but are they suitable for all functions?
          Or just short ones?
        </li>
        <br />
