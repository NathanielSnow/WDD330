          I spent most of my time with the readings. It felt like there was a
          lot to read this week, although that's probably just my imagination.
          Forms I understand, I have a basic understanding of OOP, but I'm going
          to need more time with Modules for them to make sense. I'm confident
          they will eventually as I begin to use them. As the wise person once
          said "Practice makes perfect." I also met with my team, on time, and I
          think we were a lot more solid than we were last week.
