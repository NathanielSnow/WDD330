      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time with my team and with the reading. (Just one chapter
          this week.) I also looked over the TODO assignment. I'm hoping to to
          complete a part of it each day the following week. That is if
          everything goes according to plan.
