      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent most of my time with the readings. It felt like there was a
          lot to read this week, although that's probably just my imagination.
          Forms I understand, I have a basic understanding of OOP, but I'm going
          to need more time with Modules for them to make sense. I'm confident
          they will. As the wise person once said "Practice makes perfect." I
          also met with my team, on time.

      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch8: "Itâ€™s possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the
          information in a form on the 'front end'beforeit is sent to the server
          using JavaScript"
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch8: While using "type='text'" isn't required, since it's the default,
          it is advisable to use it anyway for maintance purposes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch8: Hidden input fields are fully visable in the HTML and therefore
          should NOT be used for sensitive data.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch8: Is it better practice to hard code "input value(s) validation" or
          is it better rely on what is provided from HTML5. For instance, when
          validation a telephone number, should I create a javascript function
          or use "tel?"
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch12: The three main concepts in OOP are: encapsulation, polymorphism
          and inheritance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch12: What's the difference between using classes or using "actual
          objects" when it comes to creating a "blueprint" for objects. Don't
          they do the same thing?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch12: When examining the prototype of an object "__proto__" is an
          option but it's better to use "getPrototypeOf()."
        </li>
