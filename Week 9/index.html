      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch9: Can global objects (enviroments) be thought of as a 'canvas' (not
          to be confused with the canvas used to draw in code) where all the
          code goes. For instance "window" and "global" are essentially the same
          thing, just in different enviroments.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch9: If I can't find the global object I'm writing it, I can use the
          keyword "this" in the global scope.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Ch9: How does colorDepth help with user statistics?</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch9: "Cookies can only be read by a web page from the same domain that
          set them; they are only allowed to store 4KB of data, although 20
          cookies are allowed per domain."
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch14: Unlike cookies, web storage doesn't have a set limit, although
          browsers tend to limit that data size to 5GB per domain.
