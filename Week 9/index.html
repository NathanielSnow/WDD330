      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time reading the chapters in "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja"
          and meeting with my team as usual. However, I also thought about my
          Block proposal and assembled the basic info for it.

      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch9: Can global objects (enviroments) be thought of as a 'canvas' (not
          to be confused with the canvas used to draw in code) where all the
          code goes. For instance "window" and "global" are essentially the same
          thing, just in different enviroments. I also completed the "Managing
          the modern Front-end workflow" activity, however there were
          dependencies that were out of date, so I had to delete them for it to
          work.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch9: If I can't find the global object I'm writing it, I can use the
          keyword "this" in the global scope.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Ch9: How does colorDepth help with user statistics?</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch9: "Cookies can only be read by a web page from the same domain that
          set them; they are only allowed to store 4KB of data, although 20
          cookies are allowed per domain."
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch14: Unlike cookies, web storage doesn't have a set limit, although
          browsers tend to limit that data size to 5GB per domain.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch14: Where do all these API's come from? Are they like webpages in
          that they come from multiple servers from around the world, or is
          there an organization that monitors and stores API's?
