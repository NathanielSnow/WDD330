      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time meeting with my team and discussing our projects.
          Carlos made a very helpful suggestion for mine. It involves adding a
          "real price" input that allows a user to input what a products "real
          price" was rather than the price that was planned for, now that's real
          world thinking lol. Other than that I've been working on my project,
          making slow progress.
