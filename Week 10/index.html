      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time reading the chapters in "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja"
          and meeting with my team as usual. However, I also thought about my
          Block proposal and assembled the basic info for it. I also completed
          the "Managing the modern Front-end workflow" activity, however there
          were dependencies that were out of date, so I had to delete them for
          it to work.

        <li>
          <b>MDN-Validating Forms:</b>MDN-Validating Forms: What are some
          examples of data that could be incorrect and still slip past front-end
          validation?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MDN-Validating Forms:</b>MDN-Validating Forms: "Warning:: Never
          trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is
          validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the
          client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request."
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MDN-Validating Forms:</b>While using built-in form validation might
          be quicker, is it better practice to hand code validations using
          JavaScript? Which takes up less memory space?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MDN-Using Fetch:</b>Does fetch() work better than jquery.ajax, or
          is it still in development?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MDN-Using Fetch:</b>When something, like the Fetch API, is part of
          the "Living Standard," should it be considered "best practice" or just
          something that works more often than not?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MDN-Using Fetch:</b>I can use fetch() to upload data to a file
          using (input type="file")
        </li>
