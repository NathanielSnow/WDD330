      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time reading the chapters in "JavaScript: Novice to Ninja"
          and meeting with my team as usual. However, I also thought about my
          Block proposal and assembled the basic info for it. I also completed
          the "Managing the modern Front-end workflow" activity, however there
          were dependencies that were out of date, so I had to delete them for
          it to work.

      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch9: Can global objects (enviroments) be thought of as a 'canvas' (not
          to be confused with the canvas used to draw in code) where all the
          code goes. For instance "window" and "global" are essentially the same
          thing, just in different enviroments.
