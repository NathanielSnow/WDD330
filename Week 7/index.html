      <h3>How I Spent My Time.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I spent my time reading the readings on functions and AJAX (although
          some would say it should be Ajaj lol) The team assignment is a tough
          one, as of this writing, my team and I are still trying to work out
          it's kinks. Just proves we still have a lot left still to learn.

      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch11: A first-class objects can be "passed around in the same way as
          every other value." They can have their own properties and methods "as
          well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by
          other functions" A function is an example of a first-class value.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: When the .length property is used on the square fuction, it
          counted the number of parameters in the function which was 1 in this
          case. In array's .length counts how many values are stored in the
          array; with a string .length counts the number of characters. Can all
          theses "values" be considered paramters? Is this what the length
          function does, count the parameters of a value?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Is using "cache" a way to store temporary values; as opposed to
          using localstorage which is more long term? Or are there downsides to
          using cache?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Personal Note(Learn to use IFFEs, they allow code to be used
          just once.)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Put in baby terms, what is the difference betwee nobject
          oriented programming and procedural programming if I understand that
          break up code into smaller parts?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch13: What good is the redirect() method if no browers supports it? Is
          it used onlyl for testing?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Ch13: The "blob() method is used to read a file of raw data."</li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch13: On average, is it better to use POST or GET when when sending
          information? Why can GET send information if that is the job of POST?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch13: If I want some cool spinner graphics I can go to Ajax Load
          and/or Preloaders.net
        </li>
