        <li>
          Ch11: A first-class objects can be "passed around in the same way as
          every other value." They can have their own properties and methods "as
          well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by
          other functions" A function is an example of a first-class value.

        <li>
          Ch11: When the .length property is used on the square fuction, it
          counted the number of parameters in the function which was 1 in this
          case. In array's .length counts how many values are stored in the
          array; with a string .length counts the number of characters. Can all
          theses "values" be considered paramters? Is this what the length
          function does, count the parameters of a value?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Is using "cache" a way to store temporary values; as opposed to
          using localstorage which is more long term? Or are there downsides to
          using cache?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Personal Note(Learn to use IFFEs, they allow code to be used
          just once.)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch11: Put in baby terms, what is the difference betwee nobject
          oriented programming and procedural programming if I understand that
          break up code into smaller parts?
