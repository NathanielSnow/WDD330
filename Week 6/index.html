          I spent my time working on the TODO Assignment. I got it working in a
          functional sense, but my code is seriously lacking in the structure
          department. I pity anyone who would have to figure out my code. lol

        <li>
          I need to practice dividing my js code using the MVC pattern. I also
          need to work on using try/catch statements, especially if I'm using
          localstorage.
