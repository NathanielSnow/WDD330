      <h3>Notes/Questions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Ch5: If using a constructor function is not recommended when creating
          an object in Javascript, then why is it an option? Does it have to do
          with how OPP works?
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch5: What situations would require you to "evaluate an expression and
          use it as the property key?" Because that seems to be main reason why
          someone would use bracket notion vs dot notation when accesing a
          property value.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Ch6: Why is whitespace saved as text nodes?</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch6: Each kind of node has a numerical code. 1: "element", 2:
          "attribute", 3: "text", 8: "comment", 9: "body."
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch6: Node lists can be accessed like an array, but don't have all the
          methods associated with arrays
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch7: Do not add the parentheses to the fucntion in an
          'addEventListener' "because the function will actually be called when
          the event listener is set, instead of when the event happens!"
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Ch7: Try not to use 'click' and 'doubleClick' on the same element.
        </li>
        <br />
